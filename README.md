- 👋 Hi, my name is Hasbleidy and currently, I'm working through a Data Science bootcamp! I'm excited to continue to expand my knowledge with all available languages out there. 😊 
- 👀 I’m interested in too many things, honestly. I do love reading, so tell me what's on your TBR, and ask about my obsession with Legendborn.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding languages and machine learning.
- 💞️ I've a passion for social causes especially those that affect the black, brown, and indigenous communities.
- 📫 You can find me at home on most days (or at work most nights) wishing I had a cat to be the stereotypical millennial animal parent.
